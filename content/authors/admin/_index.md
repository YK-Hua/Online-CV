I am a master student under supervision of Prof. Dr. Jun Feng at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology. Besides, I am very fortunate to be guided by Prof. Dr. Xin He and Dr. Haodong Liu. Under their guidance, I carried out the research of layered transition metal cathodes.
